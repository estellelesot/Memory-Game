# Memory Game Project

## How to play

- The objective is to collect all pairs of cards. The game randomly shuffles the cards. 
- The player turns over any two cards and the interface will keeps them opened if the cards match.
- When the player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position).
- The trick is to remember which cards are where.
- The player wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
